# Pose Detection using MediaPipe

This project demonstrates pose detection using the MediaPipe library in Python. It analyzes video input and detects human poses, drawing landmarks and connections on the detected poses.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the required libraries installed:

- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)

You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PoseEstimation.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd PoseEstimation
```

3. Run the Python script:
```bash
python PoseEstimationModule.py

```

## About the Code
The provided Python script PoseEstimationModule.py captures video from a file, performs pose detection using MediaPipe's Pose module, and displays the processed frames with drawn landmarks and connections.
